# Recommended Good Practices for Maintaining Software Tools

We advocate the use of a number of software development best practices.
All repositories maintained by the Artificial Life Data Standards Organization use continuous integration to ensure that all code is automatically tested when a change is made.
Test coverage is measured to ensure that these test suites are comprehensive.
Lastly, static analysis is automatically performed to identify error-prone code.
